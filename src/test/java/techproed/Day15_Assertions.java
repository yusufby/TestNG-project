    /*Interview questions*/
    /*What is the difference between assertion and verification?*/
    //Assertion means hard assertion . Verification means soft assertion.
    //Verification is similar to if else statement
    //if hard assertion fails , rest of the test case stops

    /*What is the difference between soft and hard assert?*/
    //Hard assertion stops execution after assertion failure.
    // soft assert continues to execute even after failure
    //we need to create a soft assert object to do soft assertion
    //assertAll need to be used in soft assert to make the actual result
    //junit no soft assertion

    /*Which assertion do you prefer?*/
    //I used both. Both assertion are useful. But I used hard assertion the most.
    // because I need to fix the issue the moment it shows up.
    //it usually  does not make sense to wait for other tests if there is a failure.

    // if there are lots of test cases, I prefer to use hard assert
    // to find the wrong test case quickly to fix it
    //if I use soft assertion, it will run all the tests everytime even there are wrong cases in them.
    //I usually use soft assertion when I write new test cases to see if all good or some fails.
